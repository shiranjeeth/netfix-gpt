- Deploying our app to prodution
- install redux

- go to firebase docs and navigate to manage users 
- there find onAuthStateChanged
- When a user logs in or out, we can retrieve the user details and add them to the Redux store via the onAuthStateChanged method
- onAuthStateChanged should only be called once when the user signs in or signs out.
- The state should only be updated once, so wrap the details inside a useEffect with an empty dependency array ([])
